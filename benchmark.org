#+TITLE: Benchmarks of various cryptographic functions

The objective of this work is to measure the time different cryptograhic primitives take with text files of various sizes.

The operations we're gonna test are:
  - Symmetric encryption and decryption using the AES algorithm.
  - Assymetric encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm.
  - Hashing using the SHA2-256 algorithm.

TODO: Add links to wikipedia.

This program will be done using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]], as to make the program itself and the report one and the same, removing the need to add code screenshots of the implementation when explaining a concept.

* How this program works (in steps):
1. Generates all files that we will run the tests on.
2. Runs multiple simulations of encrypting, decrypting and hashing on a given set of files
3. Records various performance metrics.
4. Computes the average of those metrics.
5. Displays them visually using plots.
